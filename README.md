# CaesarLooper

CaesarLooper is a SuperCollider clone of the Augustus Loop VST plugin by Expert Sleepers.

In order for it to work you need SuperCollider:

https://supercollider.github.io/

I recommend the latest version.

IBufWr:

Once you have this working:

```
Quarks.install("https://github.com/X2theL/CaesarLooper.git")
```
